# Notepad

## Create & store your notes for later purposes.
I have used Tkinter a GUI library from python from which we can create multiple GUI apps.\ 
Here, I am using tkinter to develop a notepad like text editor.\ 
This notepad will have the menu where we can create new file, open existing file, save the file, editing, cut and paste, all functionality will be there.
### Features:
